UPDATED: 2025-05-15

Your Prose workspace can be customized from your Pod dashboard. Any customization applied from your admin interface will be seen on all your workspace members Prose apps.

**The following workspace-global parameters can be customized:**

- The workspace **name**
- The workspace **logo**
- The app **accent color** (ie. color of the buttons)

! Once you made a change in your administration dashboard, such as changing the app accent color, the change will be instantly synchronized to all your team member apps, without needing them to reload.

**In the Prose apps of your users, the interface will reflect applied customizations:**
