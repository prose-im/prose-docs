Go to [our downloads page](https://prose.org/downloads) and get the Prose application for your platform (macOS or Windows).

## Using a package manager

### 1. Homebrew (macOS)

**To install the Prose app:**

```bash
brew install --cask prose-im/tap/prose
```

**Then to update it:**

```bash
brew upgrade --cask prose-im/tap/prose
```

### 2. Other package managers

We don’t plan on maintaining packages for every package manager ourselves, but if you maintain a package and would like it to be listed here, feel free to create an issue on [prose-im/prose-docs](https://github.com/prose-im/prose-docs/issues) or reach out to [our support team](https://prose.org/contact/) if you don’t have a GitHub account.

We will then edit this page to mention your community-maintained package.
