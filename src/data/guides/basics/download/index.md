### Other package managers

We don’t plan on maintaining packages for every package manager ourselves, but if you maintain a package and would like it to be listed here, feel free to create an issue on [prose-im/prose-docs](https://github.com/prose-im/prose-docs/issues) or reach out to [our support team](#crisp-chat-open) if you don’t have a GitHub account. We will then edit this page to mention your community-maintained package.
