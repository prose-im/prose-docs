TITLE: Pod API reference
UPDATED: 2025-05-15

The Prose Pod API is one way to interact with a Prose Pod. It is what Dashboards use to configure a Prose Pod, and can be used as a way to automate things.

It is subject to changes like new features and improvements, and since Prose Pods can be self-hosted a public documentation might not align with the version you deployed.
To get the correct OpenAPI description for your Prose Pod, head over to `{prose_pod_dashboard_url}/api/api-docs/openapi.json`, or see it graphically at `{prose_pod_dashboard_url}/api/api-docs/redoc` (replacing `{prose_pod_dashboard_url}` by the URL of your Prose Pod Dashboard).
